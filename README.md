__Keywords__: CV, NLP, Deep Learning, VLMs, PyTorch, Transformers
## Problem:
Retailers struggle to understand and align product images, text descriptions, and customer reviews to flag issues (e.g., misleading images, product defects, or mismatch between title and image).
## Solution
Build a model that takes product image + title + review text and:
- Predicts mismatches or low-quality listings
- Flags customer confusion or disappointment
## Tools
- `CLIP` or `BLIP` (image + text embedding)
- `HuggingFace Transformers` for review classification
- `PyTorch` for model prototyping
- `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` for EDA
## Skills Demonstrated
- Vision-language modeling
- NLP classification
- Business framing for eCommerce
